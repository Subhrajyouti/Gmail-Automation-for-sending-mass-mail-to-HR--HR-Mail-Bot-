Dear Hiring Team at {{company}},

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in the Data Analyst position at {{company}} ({{office}} office). With hands-on experience in data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling, I am confident that my expertise aligns well with the role.
